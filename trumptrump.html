      <h2>Trump Trump</h2>
      <p><strong>Trump Trump</strong> is a content filtering app designed for iOS that automatically blocks or replaces Trump-related content across your web browsing experience.   It filters out links, websites and photos that contain the word Trump.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Trump Trump integrates directly into Safari, so you do not need to change anything about the way you browse the web. Simply enable Trump Trump and you will see how photos, images and links related to the Trump keyword disappear. Trump Trump also blocks website URLs that contain the Trump keywords, so if you accidentally follow a link to one of these sites, you will only see a blank page.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In addition to working in Safari, Trump Trump also works in certain apps that use Safari Webkit for web browsing. Trump Trump does NOT work in apps such as Facebook for iOS or Twitter for iOS. However, it will work if you access these services via the Safari web browser.</p>
